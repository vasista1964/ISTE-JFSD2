        <h2>About Ada Lovelace</h2>
        <p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, born on December 10, 1815, was an English mathematician and writer. She is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine, making her the world's first computer programmer.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Ada Lovelace's work was not widely recognized until many years after her death, but she is now celebrated as a pioneer in the field of computer science. Her vision and insight into the potential for computing have paved the way for modern technology.</p>
